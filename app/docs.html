            It is assumed the user has a working setup of

            <h2>Try radicle</h2>
            <p>Welcome to radicle. Today we will teach you how you can contribute to someone else's project. After that
              we will guide you through setting up your own project and enabling others to contribute to your project.

            <h2>How to contribute to a project</h2>
            <p>
              We've created a project for this guide where you will be adding your own message to <a
                class="reference external" href="radicle.xyz/garden">our community board</a>. Before you can start
              contributing though, you'll have to get the project on your device.
            </p>
            <p>
              To be able to get the communtity board project on your device, you'll need the project-id: <tt
                class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;PROJECT-ID&gt;</span></tt>
            </p>

To list the project's issues, run:
  rad issue list
          </pre>
            <p>
              You can see that this is using git to clone the project in a folder named after the project-name, using
              ipfs as the remote. What this also does is allow you to get the issues and diffs that are currently
              connected to this project.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let's try that out. Start by changing into that newly created folder <tt class="docutils literal">$ cd
                <span class="pre">PROJECT-NAME</span></tt>. Then let's start by listing all the issues for the project,
              we can do that by running <tt class="docutils literal">$ rad issue list</tt>.
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">

            <p>
              As you can see there is only one issue there. Since it's talking about what we want to do, let's take a
              closer look at that issue. We can do that by running <tt class="docutils literal">$ rad issue show 1</tt>.

  &lt;TODO&gt; add a comment that explains how to add a message to the board

            <p>
              Great. This person was trying to do the same thing as us and it seems like the maintainer of this project
              already commented on this issue with some steps to follow. You can use <tt class="docutils literal">$ rad
                issue comment <span class="pre">&lt;issue-number&gt;</span> &lt;body&gt;</tt> to leave a comment or dive
              right in.
            </p>
            <p>
              Start of by going into the 'messages' folder by running <tt class="docutils literal">$ cd messages</tt>.
              Then you're gonna create a new file with the date and a username (this username will be public), to do
              that you can run <tt class="docutils literal">$ touch <span
                  class="pre">yyyy-mm-dd_username.txt</span></tt>.</p>
            <p>After that you can add your personal message. It should fit in a box of 20 characters wide and 8 lines
              high.
            </p>
            <p>Some examples:</p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
    ~+     *       +
  ()      '
    .-.,="````"=.   - o -
    '=/_         \
*    |  '=._     |
      \     ``=./``,    '
    .  '=.__.=' ``=' *
  O      *        '   +
          </pre>
            <p>or</p>
            <pre class="literal-block">

          </pre>
            <p>
              Once you've created the file and added your message, save that file and commit it to the repo using git.
            </p>
            <pre class="literal-block">

              own project and how to enable others to contribute to it.</p>
            <p>First of you're going to have to create a new radicle project, to do that first run <tt
                class="docutils literal">$ rad project init</tt> and then choose a project name.</p>
            <pre class="literal-block">
$ rad project init
? What's the name of your project?
Initialising project with name: &lt;your-project-name&gt;

✓ Assembled rad-repo machine

✓ Assembled rad-diff machine

Your project id is 812396. See the id of your project by running:
  rad project show

Run --help to get started
  rad issue --help
  rad diff --help
          </pre>
            <p>There you go, that sets you up with everything you need. If now you'd like to get some other to
              contribute, simply run <tt class="docutils literal">$ rad project show</tt> and share the project id with
              them. They can then follow the steps in the <a class="reference internal"
                href="#how-to-contribute-to-a-project">How to contribute to a project</a>.</p>
            <p>Now let's say they've proposed a new diff to the project, you can then proceed by running <tt
                class="docutils literal">$ rad diff list</tt> to see them.</p>
